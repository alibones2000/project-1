# Project-1 Top 10 Movies Of All Time

In this project I created a list of my Top 10 List Of Movies of my choosing. 


## How it works

The way my code works is that first I made a fetch to localhost and made a function for Each movie it grabs the images of the movie covers and displays on the top of the screen. 

When the images are shown, I added an eventlistner so everytime the movie is clicked on, the description, rating, name, director name, release year and trailer.
